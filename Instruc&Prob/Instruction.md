## How to Ensure the Code You Submit Will Work

- The project can only be submitted once inside the project submission portal.
- Validate your submission using the provided validation Google form inside the project submission portal.
- An automated email will be sent after submitting the project file in the validation Google form.
- Submit only if the project zip folder passes the test on the above Google form.
- Once submitted, the evaluation will be based on that submission only.

## How to Submit Your Final Project

- Submit your code, report (with presentation video link), all wrapped in a single project folder, on the portal in the following format:
  - The project code, including the project report with presentation video link, and the PDF of the project report should be in a single folder.
  - Zip the folder and submit it.
  - The project folder must be in the root directory of the zip submission folder, with no other files or folders in the root directory.
- Below is an example of the ideal file tree structure.

## How We Will Evaluate Your Submitted Project

### Step 1: Executing the Submission

- Submissions will be batch processed within a given timeframe.
- An automated code will unzip the folder, check for the root folder, and the existence of a Python file.

### Step 2: If the Evaluation Fails

- If the folder cannot be unzipped or the root folder or .py file are missing, the submission will be invalid.
- You will be asked to resubmit the project within the given deadline.
- Possible scenarios for invalid submission:
  - Not a zip file.
  - The project folder does not reside in the root directory.
  - Other files or folders are in the root directory.
  - Files/folders (including project report) are not inside the project folder.
  - Submission does not contain any `.py` file.
  - Submission contains only PDF/text files.
  - Compiler is unable to unzip the submission.
  - Submission contains corrupted files or files with unrecognized extensions.
  - Any additional scenario where processing the submission fails.

### Step 3: If the Evaluation Passes but Fails Plagiarism Test

- If the root folder and .py file are found, the next step is passing the code through the plagiarism checker.
- If failed by the plagiarism checker, you will be informed.
- You can fill the grievance redressal form if you wish to contest.
- If plagiarism is proven, you will be referred to the disciplinary committee, and the event will be added to your academic records. No support for internships/placements will be provided by the IITM BS Degree program.

### Step 4: If Your Submission is Valid and Passes the Plagiarism Checker

- You will be eligible to attend Level-1 viva, an objective type assessment lasting about 20 minutes, conducted by the IITM team.

### Step 5a: If You Pass Level 1 Viva (Marks ≥ 28)

- You will be eligible to attend Level-2 viva.
- This level will assess the quality of the project work, your involvement, ability to modify the code, depth of understanding, and understanding of the course.
- Conducted by industry experts and course instructors.

### Step 5b: If You Pass Level 1 Viva (16 ≤ Marks < 28)

- If a student scores between 16 and 27 (inclusive), you will pass the project with a D or E grade.
- No need to attempt Level-2 exam.
- Grade distribution:
  - 20 ≤ M < 28: Grade D
  - 16 ≤ M < 20: Grade E
  - M < 16: Fail

### Step 5c: If You Fail Level 1 Viva (Marks < 16)

- If marks are less than 16, you can reattempt Level-1 viva by making a new submission within the deadline.
- A fee of ₹1000 is required to cover expenses.
- If not submitted before the deadline, you must re-register for the project course in the next term.

### Step 6a: If You Pass Level 2 Viva

- Successfully completing and passing Level-2 viva means your project course is completed, subject to clearance of plagiarism checks with all submissions made in that term.

### Step 6b: If You Fail Level 2 Viva

- If Level-2 is not passed, you will receive a D grade for the course.
- No reattempt is allowed for Level-2 viva.

## Dos and Don'ts While Attending the Vivas

- Have the soft copy of your ID card ready to share via screen-share.
- Ensure your microphone, camera, and screen-sharing work well before the examiner joins.

- Ensure all dependencies are installed on your local system if demonstrating locally.
- Keep a copy of your project (source code and dependencies) locally if using online platforms like replit.com.
- Rescheduling the booked slot for Level-1 or Level-2 is only allowed for medical reasons or other strong reasons acceptable to the IITM team, with a ₹1000 fee for processing overheads.
- Any flagged code by the plagiarism checker will lead to disciplinary action.

## Preliminary Level

- Follow the order: core and graded requirements, recommended requirements, and non-functional requirements like aesthetics.
- Do not change your submission after the deadline.
- Ensure the code, video, and PDF remain unchanged after submission.

## How to Avoid Plagiarism

- Do not make your code available to anyone else until you get a grade.
- Avoid uploading your code to any public repository.
- Ensure the business logic is written by yourself and avoid taking code snippets from external sources.
- Be prepared to explain your code and make modifications as suggested during the viva.
- Use the same system throughout the project development and viva process.
